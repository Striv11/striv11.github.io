								<h1>Glucose based bio fuel cells</h1>
								<p>Wearables use small cells for them to operate, well the rather easier way to do it could be using glucose present in our blood. It is a very long time span research but the idea felt pretty amazing and we started working on it. We came across 1 dimensional cells with transport equations dealing in 1d, and we tried to get those cells to have a constant current density over time. The problem with such cells is that they cannot mentain a constant potential difference or a steady supply of current throughout time. We worked over 1057 iterations to get them to do jus that by changing the transport equations and getting the concentration gradient to build up enough potential to drive the cell.</p>

								<p>A 3d study is hard to conduct to interaction between different enzymes and substrated in 3 dimension, a 1 dimensional model generates enough theoritical and simulation grounding for developing a constant voltage source. The model opens up gates to develop incisive biofuel cells that can glucose in blood to power small wearables.</p>
